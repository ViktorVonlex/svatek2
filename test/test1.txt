Extra-virgin olive oil sugar cookies made without butter in a simple, otherwise classic recipe. The result is a rich, dense cookie to sink your teeth into. These are great for dunking in your tea.

Ingredients
2 eggs

⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil

1 cup sugar

2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 pinch salt

½ cup chocolate chips (Optional)

Directions
Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Cream together eggs, olive oil, and sugar in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and pale gold in color. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Shape dough into a ball and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Use a teaspoon to drop spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space in between as cookies will spread. Refrigerate leftover dough to bake in batches.

Bake in the preheated oven until just golden around the edges, about 8 minutes. Allow to cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a cooling rack.


Cook's Notes:
The cookies and dough freeze well. The dough will last in the refrigerator up to 24 hours.

You can also use a high-gluten flour (such as Manitoba(R)) instead of all-purpose flour.

I made these with gluten-free flour, added a tspn of vanilla extract, and refrigerated overnight. My niece and I used cookie cutters to make snowman and snowflake cookies. They were yummy, but not exceptional.
